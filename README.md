# 🚖 Uber Ride Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to uncover patterns and insights into ride frequency, peak hours, pickup locations, and more. It’s a part of my data analysis learning journey where I worked with real-world datasets using Python and data visualization libraries.

## 📊 Objective

To explore and analyze Uber ride data using Python to:

- Identify trends in ride frequency over time
- Visualize pickup locations and high-demand zones
- Understand daily/weekly usage patterns
- Derive business insights from the dataset

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - datetime

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Uber Pickup Data from NYC](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city), containing trip information including date/time and pickup location.

## 📌 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time-series analysis of ride data
- Heatmaps of ride frequency
- Graphs for day-wise and hour-wise usage trends
- Visual insights into user behavior


## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrathameshBhagwat/Uber_Ride_Analysis.git
   cd Uber_Ride_Analysis
